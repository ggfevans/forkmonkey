## 🍴 Ways to Contribute

### 1. **Fork & Breed** (The Fun Way)
The easiest way to contribute is to **fork this repo** and let your monkey join the network!

[![Fork ForkMonkey](https://img.shields.io/badge/🍴_FORK_YOUR_MONKEY-00ff88?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=1a1a2e)](https://github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey/fork?utm_source=contributing&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=growth)

- Your monkey inherits traits from this repo's monkey
- It evolves daily via AI (GitHub Actions + GitHub Models)
- Your fork appears on the global [Family Tree](https://roeiba.github.io/forkMonkey/?utm_source=contributing&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=growth#family-tree)

**Pro tip:** Fork a monkey with rare traits to give your child a better starting gene pool!

### 2. **⭐ Star the Repo**
Stars help us grow and attract more breeders to the network. More monkeys = more fun!
