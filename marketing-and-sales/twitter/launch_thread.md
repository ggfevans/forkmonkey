      🐵 Introducing ForkMonkey: Your digital pet that lives forever on GitHub.

      It's an open-source experiment where a repo becomes a living creature.
      
      It evolves daily using free AI (GitHub Models) and you "breed" new ones by forking the repo.
      It's all free, public and uses free mechanism of Github.

      1/ 🧬 Genetics
      
      Every monkey has unique DNA determining its color, expression, and accessories.
      
      When you Fork the repo, you create a "child" that inherits 50% of your traits + random mutations.

      2/ 🤖 AI Evolution
      
      Every night, a GitHub Action wakes up and asks GPT-4o (via GitHub Models):
      
      "Here is this monkey's history. How should it evolve today?"
      
      The AI subtly changes its appearance based on its personality.
