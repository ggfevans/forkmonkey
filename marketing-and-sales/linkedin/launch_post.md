## Post 1: Launch Announcement

```
🐵 Just launched a weird side project: ForkMonkey

What is it?
A digital pet that lives entirely on GitHub, evolves daily using AI, and "breeds" through forking.

Why build this?
• Exploring what "serverless AI agents" can do with $0 infrastructure
• Making open source more engaging and fun
• Proving you can build autonomous systems on free tiers

The tech:
• GitHub Actions as the "heartbeat" (runs daily)
• GitHub Models (free GPT-4o access) as the "brain"
• Python for genetics/evolution logic
• SVG for procedural art generation

The interesting part:
Every fork creates a "child" monkey that inherits traits from its parent + random mutations. A family tree is forming across GitHub with 20+ monkeys already.

What I learned:
1. GitHub Actions + AI = Powerful autonomous agents
2. Gamification works even for developers
3. Sometimes the weird ideas are the best ones

## Post 2: Technical Deep Dive (Day 3)

```
How I built a $0/month AI system that runs forever 🤖

Last week I launched ForkMonkey - a digital pet on GitHub.

Here's the architecture that makes it cost nothing:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 "𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿": GitHub Actions
• Cron job runs daily at midnight UTC
• Free for public repos (2000 minutes/month)
• Acts as the autonomous "heartbeat"

𝗧𝗵𝗲 "𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻": GitHub Models
• Free GPT-4o access via Azure AI
• Just use your GITHUB_TOKEN as the API key
• Perfect for low-volume, high-value AI calls

𝗧𝗵𝗲 "𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲": Git commits
• State stored as JSON in the repo
• Full history/versioning for free
• No database to manage

𝗧𝗵𝗲 "𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴": GitHub Pages
• Static site served from the repo
• Custom domain support
• Zero config deployment

Total monthly cost: $0

This pattern works for:
• Auto-updating dashboards
• Living documentation
• Scheduled reports
• Any "fire and forget" automation

Code is open source: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey

What would YOU build with this pattern?

## Post 3: Milestone Celebration (When you hit 100+ forks)

```
🎉 100 ForkMonkeys are now evolving on GitHub!

One week ago, I launched a weird experiment.

Today, 100 unique digital pets are autonomously evolving across GitHub.

The network has:
• [X] generations deep
• [X] countries represented
• [X] unique trait combinations

What surprised me:
• People actually check on their monkeys daily
• The competition for rare traits is real
• Community formed faster than expected

Top 3 rarest monkeys right now:
🥇 @user1 - Rarity 94/100
🥈 @user2 - Rarity 89/100
🥉 @user3 - Rarity 87/100

Thank you to everyone who forked, starred, and shared.

The experiment continues: github.com/roeiba/forkMonkey
