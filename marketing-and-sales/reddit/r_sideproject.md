# Title: I built a self-evolving digital pet that lives entirely in a GitHub Repo (and it breeds via Forking)

Hey r/SideProject!

I wanted to share a fun open-source project I've been working on to gamify GitHub interaction.

**Project:** ForkMonkey
**Desc:** It's a Tamagotchi-style digital pet that lives in your repository's README.
**The Twist:** It uses **free AI** (GitHub Models / gpt-4o) to evolve its appearance every day, and you "breed" new ones by forking the repo.

### 🧬 Key Features:
*   **Zero Cost Servers**: It runs entirely on GitHub Actions (serverless).
*   **Free AI**: Leverages the new GitHub Models free tier for the evolution logic.
*   **Viral Mechanics**: Forking creates a unique child with inherited traits (50% parent / 50% random).
*   **Persistent**: As long as GitHub exists, your monkey lives.

I built this to experiment with "autonomous agents" that don't require me to pay for a VPS hosting them.
It's all free, public and uses free mechanism of Github.

Would love to hear what you think about the "Repo as a Pet" concept!
