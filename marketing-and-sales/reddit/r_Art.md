**Title:**
Evolution of a Digital Primate, ForkMonkey (Me/Python Code), Animated SVG, 2025

**Image/Video:**
[Upload `monkey_evolution/evolution.gif`]

**Comment (Context):**
This is an animation showing the modification of a single SVG file over time.
It's generated by a Python script I wrote that "evolves" the artwork daily based on a genetic algorithm and AI (Claude/GPT).
Each frame represents a generation where the code mutated the visual traits (colors, patterns, accessories).

It's all free, public and uses free mechanism of Github.
