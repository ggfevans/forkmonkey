## Paragraph Description

ForkMonkey is an open-source experiment in "living code" – a digital pet that exists entirely within a GitHub repository. Using GitHub Actions as its heartbeat and GPT-4o (via GitHub Models' free tier) as its brain, each monkey evolves autonomously every day based on its unique history and personality.

The twist: forking the repository creates a "child" monkey that inherits traits from its parent with random mutations – just like real genetics. This has created a growing family tree across GitHub, with monkeys competing on a rarity leaderboard.

The entire system costs $0 to run indefinitely, proving that sophisticated AI agents can be built on free infrastructure.

## Key Features

1. **Autonomous Evolution**: AI decides daily changes based on the monkey's history
2. **Genetic Breeding**: Fork = breed a child with inherited traits + mutations
3. **Rarity System**: Traits have different rarity levels (Common → Legendary)
4. **Family Tree**: Visual lineage tracking across GitHub accounts
5. **Leaderboard**: Compete for the highest rarity score
6. **Achievements**: 12 unlockable milestones
7. **Zero Cost**: Runs forever on GitHub's free tier

---

## Technical Highlights

- **No servers**: Entirely serverless via GitHub Actions
- **Free AI**: Uses GitHub Models (GPT-4o) with GITHUB_TOKEN
- **State in Git**: JSON files committed to repo = database
- **SVG Art**: Procedurally generated monkey visualizations
- **Python**: Clean, readable codebase (~2000 lines)
