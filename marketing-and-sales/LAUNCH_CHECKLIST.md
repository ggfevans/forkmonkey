| Twitter Impressions | 10K+ | |

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If HN post is flagged/dead:
1. Don't panic
2. Email hn@ycombinator.com explaining the project
3. Ask friends NOT to mass-upvote (looks like manipulation)

### If adoption wizard breaks:
1. Check Cloud Run logs
2. Fallback: Direct users to manual fork
3. Post update in comments

### If rate limited on Reddit:
1. Wait 10 minutes between posts
2. Use different subreddits
3. Have backup account ready (not for manipulation, just in case)
