        # 🧬 Breed Request
        
        Want your monkey to inherit specific traits from another monkey in the network?
        
        Fill out this form and we'll guide you through the breeding process!
        
        **How breeding works:**
        - Fork the parent monkey's repo → Your new monkey inherits ~50% of their traits
        - Random mutations add another layer of uniqueness
        - Rare traits have a chance to be passed down!
